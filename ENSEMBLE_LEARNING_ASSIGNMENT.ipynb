        "1. When Interpretability is Crucial\n",
        "✅ Issue: Ensemble models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) are often black boxes.\n",

        "How Does Bagging Reduce Overfitting?\n",
        "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique that helps reduce overfitting by training multiple models on different random subsets of the data and averaging their predictions. It is particularly useful for high-variance models like Decision Trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Ways Bagging Reduces Overfitting\n",
        "1. Reduces Variance Through Averaging\n",
        "✅ Issue: A single model (e.g., a deep Decision Tree) tends to overfit by memorizing noise in the data.\n",
        "✅ Solution: Bagging trains multiple models on different subsets and takes an average (for regression) or majority vote (for classification), smoothing out individual model errors.\n",
        "✅ Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "If one Decision Tree overfits by capturing noise, other trees trained on different data will reduce this effect.\n",
        "The final prediction is more stable and less sensitive to individual tree errors.\n",
        "2. Uses Bootstrapped Sampling (Data Randomness)\n",
        "✅ Issue: A single model trained on one dataset might capture patterns too specifically.\n",
        "✅ Solution: Bagging randomly samples data with replacement, ensuring that each model sees slightly different variations of the data.\n",
        "✅ Effect: This diversity in training helps models learn general patterns instead of overfitting to specific noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Reduces Over-Reliance on Specific Features (Feature Randomness in Random Forests)\n",
        "✅ Issue: Overfitting occurs when a model relies too much on a specific feature set.\n",
        "✅ Solution: In Random Forest, each tree considers only a random subset of features, ensuring different decision-making paths.\n",
        "✅ Effect: This prevents models from always picking the most dominant features, leading to better generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Creates Independent Models That Are Less Correlated\n",
        "✅ Issue: A single complex model may memorize the dataset instead of learning general patterns.\n",
        "✅ Solution: By training multiple independent models and averaging their outputs, Bagging ensures that the final prediction is less influenced by outliers or noise in any single model."
